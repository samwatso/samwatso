## Hey, I'm Sam 👋

Integration Architect based in London 🇬🇧, day job is SAP BTP, SAP Integration Suite and S/4HANA. Lots of PI/PO migration work, regulated environments, that kind of thing.

In my spare time I build things, mostly to scratch an itch or just because it seemed like a fun problem to solve.

🏢 **At work** - enterprise integration delivery at Capgemini and NTT DATA across complex SAP landscapes. Clients include GE Aviation.

🤽 **Weekends** - I play underwater hockey (yes, it's real) and volunteer running the club. Built [Wickham Wave](https://wwuwh.com) to manage it all, 50+ members, web, iOS and Android, attendance, billing, scheduling, gamification, the lot.

🤖 **Tinkering** - AI-assisted tooling, MCP-style agent concepts, using AI to get a better handle on my own finances, meal planning tools for the house. Nothing commercial, just things I actually use.
